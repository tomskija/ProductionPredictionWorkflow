## Application Workflow on Production Prediction using Random Forest Model Given 1 of the 7 Sampling Methods
#### Creating new project based on applying several sampling methods and feature selection methods in order to predict production at a high rate using a random foresr model
#### Workflow summary
* By performing feature engineering, the machine learning methods were able to perform optimally, thereby enabling more reliable results with potential outliers removed and the variances of each feature standardized to one with a mean of zero.
* During feature selection, I utilized the derived correlation coefficients plus the mutual information and feature importance to find the 4 optimal predictive features that had a high correlation to Production, yet were not highly correlated between each other. Computing these coefficients was another way to mitigate the chance of multicollinearity (i.e., decrease the dimensionality of the problem, and decrease the chance of redundant features), and to allow for the random forest model to perform optimally.
* Random Sampling, K-means Clustering and GMMs were employed to generate various training and testing datasets. The clustering methods aimed to achieve a reduction in the sampling bias by exposing the predictive machine learning models to data points representing similar geological regions and feature value distributions in both the derived training and testing datasets. I performed a 70/30 train-test split, and found that the clustering methods employed derived clusters based on geological regions that had similar production rate values. This proecdure did seem to reduce the sampling bias in most of the given training and testing dataset scenarios when analyzing histogram distributions of the features and scatter plots of the production wells.
* The 4 optimal predictive features found for the random forest method were consistent for each training and testing dataset generated, and allowed for extremely high accuracy and extremely low error in the machine learning model performance. Of course, finding the optimal random state to sample from the clusters or entire map helped in achieving these results.
* In the end, this workflow has created an enhanced AI workflow for finding a relationship between a set of predictive features and oil production in order to optimize hydrocarbon production when hydraulically fracturing the reservoir.
